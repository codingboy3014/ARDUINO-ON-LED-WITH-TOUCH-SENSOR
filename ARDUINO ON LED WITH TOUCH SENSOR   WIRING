Components:
Arduino Uno
Touch Sensor Module (e.g., TTP223)
LED (Built-in LED on pin 13 of the Arduino Uno)
Resistor (220Ω) (only needed if you're using an external LED)
Jumper Wires
Breadboard (optional)


Connections:

Touch Sensor Module (e.g., TTP223):
VCC → 5V on Arduino
GND → GND on Arduino
OUT → Pin 2 on Arduino

LED (Built-in LED on Arduino Pin 13):

Pin 13 on the Arduino Uno has a built-in LED, so no external LED is needed. You can use this pin directly to control the LED.
If you're using an external LED:

Anode (long leg) → Pin 13 on Arduino (through a 220Ω resistor)
Cathode (short leg) → GND on Arduino
